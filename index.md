This is a custom curriculum developed by the University of Michigan Carpentries instance. 
While it is based on The Carpentries curriculum and teaching practices, 
it is not officially overseen by The Carpentries organization. 
We welcome any feedback or questions to us through

The curriculum is developed for complete beginners interested in 
learning reproducible data science techniques and integrates instruction 
of R for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization; the Unix shell; and 
git and GitHub. For more details, please see

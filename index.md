This is a custom curriculum developed by the University of Michigan Carpentries instance. It is in the `alpha` stage of development. 

The curriculum is developed for complete beginners interested in learning reproducible data science techniques and integrates instruction of R for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization; the Unix shell; and git and GitHub. For more details, please see [Introduction to the Workshop](https://umcarpentries.org/intro-curriculum-r/00-welcome/index.html).
